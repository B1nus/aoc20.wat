Solving [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) using the [text format](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/text/index.html). You can use [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) or any other Webassembly runtime to run my solutions. You need to pipe the input file into the program. On linux you can do `cat 1.txt | wasmtime 1.wat` for example. For anybody wanting to do something similar, there are great examples in the [Webassembly testsuite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite).
