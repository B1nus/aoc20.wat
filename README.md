Solving [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). I write in the binary format and I use the web as my host environment. Run my solutions with my helper python script *server.py* and give the argument of the day to test: `$ python serve.py 5`. You also need some input files of your own.
